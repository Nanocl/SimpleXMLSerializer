# SimpleXMLSerializer
@author Kay Schr√∂er (acsf.dev@gmail.com)

This is a very basic XML serializer. It stores Java objcts in a XML file or loads a XML file and map its content back to a Java object.

The idea behind is not to have to rely on extensive frameworks such as Apache Xerces to manage configuration files, but to manage with only a few classes.
